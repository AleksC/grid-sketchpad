Created as an exercise as a part of The Odin Project.

Goal of the exercise was:

Create a web page (or use JSFiddle) with a 16x16 grid of square divs. Create your divs using Javascript/jQuery Set up a hover effect so it changes the color of the square when your mouse passes over it, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would. Add a button to the top of the screen which will clear the current grid and send the user a popup asking for how many squares per side to make the new grid. Once entered, the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) and now you've got a new sketch pad.
